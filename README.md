# In this code, replace `your_api_token_here` with the API token obtained from the BotFather, and `your_chat_id_here` with the chat ID of the user you want to send the message to. You can obtain the chat ID by starting a chat with the bot and sending the `/start` command to it, and then looking for the `chat` object in the JSON response returned by the bot API.
